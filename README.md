# Angular-Drum-Machine

A drum machine entirely made in HTML5, AngularJS and Foundation. 
A little fun without server side logic.


## Some notes

* MS Explorer doesn't supports audio at the moment. Please try with Mozilla or Chrome, or another serious browser.
* local use: if you download the files and open index.html with Chrome, it will NOT work. This is due to Chrome limitations on XMLHttpRequest to local files.
To fix this you can:

1. use another browser like Mozilla, OR
1. use a local web server, for example: IIS / IIS Express, Apache, Node.js, nginx, Gunicorn, Python http.server module, ...) OR
1. use Chrome with local web security disabled (--allow-file-access-from-files)
